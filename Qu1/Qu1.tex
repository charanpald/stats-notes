\begin{frame}{Exercise I}
To measure the dependence of age on cardio-vascular risk, 12 patients are observed, for which we record the age in years ($X$) and the dosage of a protein called D-dimer ($Y$). We give the following quantities: 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\sum x_i =596; \sum x_i^2 = 32435; \sum y_i = -5.2; \\ 
 \sum y_i^2 = 4.3; \sum x_i y_i = -188.58  
\end{eqnarray*}
\begin{enumerate} 
 \item Calculate the correlation coefficient between $X$ and $Y$. 
 \item Calculate the equation for linear regression of $Y$ on $X$. 
 \item What is the predicted value of $Y$ for a person of 60 years old? 
\end{enumerate}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Exercise II-a}
A village by the sea wants to protect itself from flooding caused by tide and wind using a seawall. The seawall has already been submerged multiple times.  Let the current year be $0$ and let's say a random variable $X_i$ is the maximal height of water (from the base of the seawall) during year $i$, $i \geq 1$. Assume $X_i$ are independent and from a distribution $X$ with a CDF of $F(x) = P(X \leq x)$. We assume that $F$ is continuous and strictly increasing in the range $[0, \infty)$ in $[0, 1)$. 
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Exercise II-b} 
Denote $Z_n$ as the maximum water height in the $n$ previous years. 
\begin{enumerate}
 \item Express the event $P(Z_n \leq x)$ as a function of $F$. 
 \item The village wants to increase the height of the seawall to the optimal height so that it protects against flooding without costing too much. Determine the minimum height $h_\alpha$ the seawall can be such that the probability of it being submerged once in $n$ years is $\leq \alpha$.  
 \item Show graphically how we can obtain $h_\alpha$ from $F$. 
\end{enumerate}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Exercise III} 
We have a set of observations $X_1, \ldots, X_n$ from distribution $P_{\theta^*}$ where $\theta^* \in \mathbb{R}$ and  $P_{\theta^*}$ has the density function 
\begin{displaymath} 
p(\theta^*, x) = \frac{1}{2} \exp^{-|x - \theta^*|}, \quad \forall x \in \mathbb{R} 
\end{displaymath}
\begin{itemize} 
 \item Show that the above is a density function and that the median of the sample is the MLE of $\theta^*$ (assume $\min_Q \sum_i |X_i - Q| = med(X_1,\ldots,X_n)$)  
 \item Show that the empirical mean of the sample is a consistent estimator and asymptotically normal for $\theta^*$ 
\end{itemize}
